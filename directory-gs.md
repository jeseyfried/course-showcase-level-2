# Site Directory
This page demonstrates a standard "card" directory to access site pages. Of course you can have multiple directory pages that link to whatever. 


The content of the cards is created through a Google Sheet. The URL is specified in the page's YAML header. In this case, it's 
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pP8KhM3E5rmA3ce2Q3oKNFmqJHnEuLT15Nkp_NI61u8/edit?usp=sharing#gid=0)

You'll want to create your own Google Sheet, make sure it's publically visible, and replace the sample URL in the YML header with the link to your Sheet.

The style of cards is easily configurable through CSS properties (changing colors, fonts, sizing, etc) in /assets/css/main.css
